# Digital Twin of Paper Mill Waste Water Treatment Process
This project is the result of work I did during an internship in college. Collaborating with an Environmental Engineering professor, I developed a website that simulates the wastewater treatment process of a paper mill in Augusta, Georgia. The goal was to create a tool that allows the paper mill to model and adjust its wastewater treatment process without impacting actual operations.

## My Contributions
When I started my internship, the professor already had Python scripts to simulate the paper mill's wastewater treatment process. However, these scripts were not user-friendly, especially for non-programmers. My role was to develop a web-based front end that allowed users to input data for the simulations easily. This also involved integrating the front end with the existing Python scripts on the backend to create a seamless and accessible tool.

### Advanced Page
#### This page is for running simulations with many different inputs. It also allows for up to 3 simulations to be run at the same time with all the results shown on one graph.
